      <h2>About Myself :)</h2>
      <h3>Work Experience</h3>
      <p>
        I hail from the fair city of Maple Valley forty five minutes outside of Seattle. Upon hearing the call to adventure I ventured out to the fabled land of Washington DC. Once there I obtained a bachelors in philosophy in two and a half years. After graduating I returned to obscurity of Washington and took a series of wonderful and insightful jobs. I managed the Northwest branch of Myriad Games retail stores and worked as an office coordinator at an intellectual property firm. Seeking a deeper understandng if tech I worked at the company <a href="https://moz.com/"><span class="moz">Moz</span></a>  as a Customer Support Engineer for a year and a half.
      </p>
      <h3>Current Interests</h3>
      <p>
        My current interest is to go into network security. On my own time:
        <ol>
          <li>Buffer Overflows</li>
          <li>DDOS Attacks</li>
          <li>Network defenses including</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Canary Stacks</li>
            <li>Non-Executable Memory</li>
            <li>Randomized Address Stacking</li>
          </ul>
        </ol>I study buffer overflows, social engineering attacks, DDOS attacks, and all of the ways to prevent them from occuring. When granted a bit of spare time I will often be playing Netrunner and reading Brandon Sanderson novels.
